add the openAI enviroment variable to your .env file

OPENAI_API_KEY = "someGibberishhereSoNoERRORShappen"

give the key some gibberish string so the server doesn't error at you

IF you want to make AI calls setup your own openAI account @: https://platform.openai.com/signup

Note: you'll need to fund your account with $15-$20. api call's don't cost too much. Testing this app for ~2months cost about $2.28
